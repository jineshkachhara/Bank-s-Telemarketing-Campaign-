# Bank-s-Telemarketing-Campaign-
A Portuguese Bank has provided 42,000 rows of customer data out of which 4665 customers were converted in subscribing to term deposit.
From these 4665 customer data we need to identify a pattern that would help us determine significant group of customers that could be targeted.
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution where these marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required in order to sell the product(bank term deposit)
